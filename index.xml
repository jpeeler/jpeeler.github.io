      <description>I took a course from coursera on &amp;ldquo;learning how to learn&amp;rdquo;. I was planning on writing about it since it&amp;rsquo;s universally applicable to all who wish to learn about how the brain works. Turns out it fit the criteria for the final assignment, so double win. Since I took notes as I went through the course, the text is more like summarized notes. Enjoy!
Thinking modes There are two different types of brain processing that occur almost mutually exclusively.</description>

      <description>New year, new blog, new technology This is my first post rendered using Hugo. I chose it over Pelican because:
 Hugo has a built-in webserver (hugo server serves content on localhost:1313).
 Hugo has an autorefresh (called live reload) feature that not only detects local changes, but reloads the browser content automatically.
 Hugo is supposedly the fastest renderer around, though apparently using server-side syntax highlighting may slow down things a bit.</description>
